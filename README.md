# Imperfect Palindrome and super anagrams
 
This program takes two words from an input file, and checks if the first word is an imperfect palindrome, if the second word is an imperfect palindrome and if those two words are super anagrams of each other. We can put any number of words, as long as they are in pairs in the form one pair in one line. A sample file is also provided.
